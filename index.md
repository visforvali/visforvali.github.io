# _Initialize_ and _Reboot_ Can Be One and the Same
&mdash; _V. Manivannan © 2025_
\
The writer syncs her drives. Filesystem check lights and extinguishes debris, in cycles. {% init reboot %}. Slows, hangs. Rebuilds an index. Remaps locations. The banyan is a tree whose branches are root systems. It walks, or does not walk so much as extend itself indefinitely. Out of a kernel issues (a: the world, b: a fatal exception, c: the right answer, d: a repository for everything that defies categorization or professional legitimacy &mdash; interactive fictocritical narrative; experimental tiny games; excerpts from my dissertation webtext; transgenre, interdisciplinary, multimodal compositions; work-in-progress &mdash; or can't be put elsewhere for reasons of bandwidth). Corruption detected, the reboot hangs. _Fsck. Fsck._ If the world is not all banyan it is because it gatekeeps chance. Like automatons, we have forgotten what the middle distance is for, but you'll have to refurbish your eyes yourself; I have already gone on too long.

The description of a disabled bodymind brute-force trial-and-erroring its way through normative composition, coding, designing, and cognitive recall, suggesting all are initially rendered as glitchy, skeletal processes, frequently caught in blankly repeating loops, until some fortuitous energy rescues the endeavor. In all states, a poetic and inflorescent thing persists.
