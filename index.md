# No Branches but Roots on the Tree That Walks

The earliest linguistic confusion I consciously remember was banyan, which seemed to simultaneously denote a tree with special medicinal and spiritual properties and a man's undershirt. 

I built my associations 

The banyan does not walk so much as extend itself, rhizomatically, horizontally, indefinitely. 

This repository is for everything I do that doesn't go anywhere else or can't be put anywhere else, for reasons of professional "legitimacy" or hosting bandwidth: 

 interdisciplinary, transgenre, interactive, digital, multimodal compositions, including my webtext dissertation, tiny games, interactive narrative, and other audiovisual content.
