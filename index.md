# init 6

The writer syncs her drives. Filesystem check cleans up after herself. _Initialize reboot_. She slows, hangs. Rebuilds an index. Remaps locations. The banyan is a tree whose branches are root systems. It walks, or does not walk so much as extend itself indefinitely. Out of a kernel issues {a: the world | b: a fatal exception | c: the right answer | d: a repository for everything that defies categorization or professional legitimacy&mdash;interactive fictocritical narrative; experimental tiny games; excerpts from my dissertation webtext; transgenre, interdisciplinary, multimodal compositions; work-in-progress&mdash;or can't be put elsewhere for reasons of bandwidth.}. Corruption detected, the reboot hangs. Fsck. Fsck. If the world is not all banyan it is because it gatekeeps chance. Like automatons, we have forgotten what the middle distance is for, but I have already gone on too long. &mdash;_V. Manivannan, 2025_
