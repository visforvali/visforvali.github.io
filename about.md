# Me
\
<span lang="ta">வணக்கம் (vanakkam | welcome)</span>! I'm @visforvali (she/her). I'm an Eelam Tamil American chronically ill writer, scholar, artist, and designer. My work is interdisciplinary, multimodal, transgenre, and open access, emphasizing the culturally specific nature of chronic pain and fatigue while using anomalously embodied composition to enact it. I'm currently an Assistant Professor in the Dept. of English, Writing, and Cultural Studies at Pace University – Pleasantville (PLV) and director of the PLV Writing-Enhanced Course (WEC) program. I received my Ph.D. in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers University and my M.F.A. in Creative Writing – Fiction from Columbia University.

## This Site

As I find myself increasingly self-hosting work that publication forums can't, and composing work I'd like to share "teasers" of prior to publication, I felt a consolidated space for all of it was in order. Here you can find excerpts of my webtext dissertation (the first digital dissertation at Rutgers School of Communication and Information), most of my published and WIP games, interactive narratives developed for specific classes, participatory toolkits, etc. 

This site was revised during a massive flare-up, when I struggled to process words and code, couldn't rely on vision, finger dexterity, or the ability to be upright, and had little patience for the vagaries of my bodymind let alone my mistakes. I have intentionally left in my resulting inelegant workarounds and paranoiacally high number of commits, as evidence of a dynamic way of being and knowing that is only intermittently legitimate in the clinic and academy.
