Below is a list of games written for scholarly, creative, pedagogical, or activist reasons, listed in reverse chronological order.

"Ali Cornwall" is now a household name, and you think you want for nothing. But there's new talent circulating, and you can't help but hear about Giles Hall, the man who filled your shoes as West Africa war correspondent, proving himself through his reporting on Ebola, Sierra Leone, The Gambia.
