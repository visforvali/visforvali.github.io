Below is the link to a self-hosted excerpt of my digital dissertation, completed in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Ph.D. in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers University. Since this webtext was the first digital dissertation in the School of Communication and Information, the university lacked the infrastructure to host it themselves.

<a href="https://vyshalimanivannan.com/public-defense/" target="_blank">Public Presentation</a>

_Content tags_: Academic ableism, chronic pain and fatigue, diasporic-disabled composition, digital rhetoric, intergenerational trauma, medical gaslighting, near-death experience, Tamil genocide

_Inventio_: Composed using HTML5, Bootstrap 5, CSS, JS, Markdown, Python. (This is just an excerpt, but the full webtext represents the complete version of my dissertation, whereas the formatted version on file with ProQuest omits most of the interactive content.)

_Summary_: This project follows a broad set of choppy queries, including: What can a body do? What language does it speak, or what language is used to speak for it? How does the vulnerability and contingency of/in my chronically pained body echo structural flaws in society and mass culture? How do (mostly) accepted alternative practices, like bodywork, acupuncture, and body modification reconstitute the relationships between body and self, pain and personhood, and client and hands-on practitioner? And by experimenting with the sensory hierarchy, simulating contingency, and intervening with technology, how might we learn to differently and more expansively express and receive articulations of pain typically unrecognized by both medical technology and the untrained human eye?
