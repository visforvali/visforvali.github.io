# This Is About the Body, the Mind, the Academy, the Clinic, Time, and Pain
&#169; 2022

_Content tags_: Academic ableism, chronic pain and fatigue, diasporic-disabled composition, digital rhetoric, intergenerational trauma, medical gaslighting, near-death experience, Tamil genocide

_Inventio_: Composed using HTML5 and Bootstrap 5 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Ph.D. in Communication, Information, and Media from Rutgers University. (This is just an excerpt, but the full webtext represents the complete version of my dissertation, whereas the formatted version on file with ProQuest omits most of the interactive content.) In loving memory of my <span lang="ta">Appa</span>, who did not live to see this work finished, and who taught me <span lang="ta">அறிவுடையார் எல்லா முடையார் (arivudaiyar ella mudaiyar)</span>: that someone who possesses knowledge possesses everything.

"This is About the Body, the Mind, the Academy, the Clinic, Time, and Pain" is a capacious title for a sprawling project. I see these items as inextricably intertwined for the chronically pained subject. It's difficult to pinpoint a single argument for such a project, which follows a broad set of choppy queries, such as: What can a body do? What language does it speak, or what language is used to speak for it? How does the vulnerability and contingency of/in my chronically pained body echo structural flaws in society and mass culture? How do (mostly) accepted alternative practices, like bodywork, acupuncture, and body modification reconstitute the relationships between body and self, pain and personhood, and client and hands-on practitioner? And by experimenting with the sensory hierarchy, simulating contingency, and intervening with technology, how might we learn to differently and more expansively express and receive articulations of pain typically unrecognized by both medical technology and the untrained human eye?
