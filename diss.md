"Everywhere I go, the wolves are at the gate. It's just that you can't hear them. How many of us have sat in darkened rooms like this, flirting with the edge, because we enter clinical spaces without traumatic skeletal injury on our x-rays, no adhesions on our CT scans, no abnormalities on our MRIs or ultrasounds, no wincing before the physician's eyes? We are haunted, seen by doctors who don't believe in ghosts, who fail to see us, and failing, deny us diagnoses, medications, referrals, who say, 'If you could walk here, you don't need painkillers,' 'But you look so well, there can't be anything wrong! Symptoms like these are usually psychosomatic; you need to relax,' 'Oh, you'd know if it was a chronic pain disorder, you'd be crying from the pain,' 'You're smart and conventionally attractive. I'm sorry. No one will believe you,' 'Some doctors view you one way and don't want to see anything else,' 'You're too young to have that much pain. There's a reason we call it a wastebasket diagnosis,' and that reason is that we are cheaper and easier to discard."

"THIS IS ABOUT THE BODY, THE MIND, THE ACADEMY, THE CLINIC, TIME, AND PAIN is a capacious title for a sprawling project. I see these items as inextricably intertwined for the chronically pained subject. It's difficult to pinpoint a single argument for such a project, which follows a broad set of choppy queries, such as: What can a body do? What language does it speak, or what language is used to speak for it? How does the vulnerability and contingency of/in my chronically pained body echo structural flaws in society and mass culture? How do (mostly) accepted alternative practices, like bodywork, acupuncture, and body modification reconstitute the relationships between body and self, pain and personhood, and client and hands-on practitioner? And by experimenting with the sensory hierarchy, simulating contingency, and intervening with technology, how might we learn to differently and more expansively express and receive articulations of pain typically unrecognized by both medical technology and the untrained human eye?"

In loving memory of my <span lang="ta">Appa</span>, who did not live to see this work finished, and who taught me <span lang="ta">அறிவுடையார் எல்லா முடையார் (arivudaiyar ella mudaiyar)</span>: that someone who possesses knowledge possesses everything.
